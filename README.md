# Kosmorro Tap

This repository is the official Homebrew Tap to install and keep Kosmorro up to date on macOS.

## How do I install formulae inside this Tap?

First, tell Homebrew to subscribe to this Tap:

```bash
brew tap kosmorro/tap
```

Then, use `brew install` to install a formula:

```bash
brew install <formula>
```

Once installed, you will be able to get package updates as soon as they are published with `brew upgrade`.

**Note:** this Tap is maintained for macOS only. On Linux, see the alternative ways on [Kosmorro website](https://kosmorro.space/cli/download/linux).
